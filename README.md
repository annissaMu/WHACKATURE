<h1>LiDARTours!</h1>

<h4>Hack made by Annissa Mu, Artemios Kayas, Emma Lim, and Kate Macvicar for the 2022 MLH WHACKATHON</h4>

We are LiDARTours! Our goal is to provide you with a safe alternative to inperson tours, and allow you to get a view and layout without leaving you're house. To create a 3D scan, we used Lidar technology, which uses lasers to calculate distance from the scanner to the object being scanned. Using VR, we placed users inside the resulting scan, allowing them to view the room as if they are actually there. While the Lidar scan was able to accurately capture most of the room, we noticed some faults in the technology. The scanner had difficulty accurately rendering reflective surfaces like mirrors, computer monitors, and windows, which resulted in blurred, distorted, and missing objects. Many of the small objects present in the scene also came out distorted. Some examples seen in the demo include coffee mugs, books, and lamps. Because Lidar is reliant on reflected light to scan objects, we found that areas hidden in shadows were also lacking in detail and clarity. Despite our issues with some objects lacking in quality compared to the rest of the scan, the main details are comprehensible enough that users are able to get a full experience.
